## Seating
1. If you already have a group, it will be helpful to start sitting next to each other.
2. If you don't have a group, hang tight we are working on it.
3. Please setup your computer as normal for today.

## Warm-up
1. In the data folder there is an epidemiology data set on an outbreak of malaria.
```{r}
malaria <- read_csv(here("lab9", "data", "malaria.csv")) %>% clean_names()
```
```{r}
malaria
```

2. `rdt` refers to rapid diagnostic test and they are identified here by age group.
3. Make the data tidy and store them as a new object.
```{r}
malaria_tidy <- malaria %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("malaria_rdt"),
               names_to = "age_class",
               values_to = "cases") %>%
  select(newid, data_date, submitted_date, location_name, province, district, age_class, cases)

malaria_tidy
  
```

4. Which district had the highest *total* number of cases on July 30, 2020?
```{r}
malaria_tidy %>%
  filter(data_date == "2020-07-30")%>%
  group_by(district)%>%
  summarize(tot_cases = sum(cases, na.rm =T)) %>%
  arrange(-tot_cases)

```
